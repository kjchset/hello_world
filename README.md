### Creating a Branch
A branch in GitHub is essentially a copy of your project's code<br> where you can make changes without affecting the main (or primary) codebase.
#### Steps to Create a Branch:
##### 1. Clone the repository:
    we had one commond to Clone
###### "git clone https://github.com/kiranraj557/image_editor.git"
##### 2. Create a new branch:
      we also have command to create branch
        "git checkout -b "requriments"
       This command creates new branch <br> and Switched to a new branch 'requriments'
##### 3. push the branch to git hub
       git push origin requriments
  This sends our newly created branch "requiremnts" to GitHub.
### Purpose of Creating a Branch:
 + ###### Isolated Development:
         can work on a new feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase (usually the main or master branch).
 + ###### Collaboration: 
        Team members can work on different features or fixes in parallel without interfering with each other's work.
 + ###### Testing: 
         You can experiment with new ideas or test code without breaking the main project.
 + ###### Pull Requests:
         After completing work on a branch, you can create a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch.<br> This allows other team members to review the code before it's merged.
